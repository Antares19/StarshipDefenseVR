## Beta Disclaimer

VRTK v4 has not yet been released fully is still in the beta phase meaning there may still be undiscovered bugs, missing features and a lack of usable documentation. All of these things are being worked on but progress is slow as there is only one person actively working on VRTK v4 in their spare time so please be patient and respectful. You are free to use VRTK v4 in any way you wish, but if you feel you will struggle figuring stuff out for yourself without detailed documentation then it may be better off if you wait until the full release of VRTK v4. 

## Introduction

VRTK aims to make building spatial computing solutions in the [Unity] software fast and easy for beginners as well as experienced developers.

This repository contains an example Unity project showcasing how to use the [VRTK.Prefabs] package to create spatial experiences. If you only wish to use the VRTK.Prefabs within your own Unity project then follow the [VRTK.Prefabs Getting Started] guide.

> You do not need to download anything else to get this Unity project running, simply open the downloaded Unity project in the Unity software as outlined by the Getting Started guide below.
